# LangChain Structured Output Demo 🚀

This repository demonstrates how to use **LangChain structured outputs** to generate reliable, schema-based responses (JSON) from Large Language Models.  
It focuses on enforcing output formats to make LLM responses **predictable, machine-readable, and production-ready**.

---

## 📌 What This Repo Covers

- Structured output generation using LangChain
- Schema / JSON-based response validation
- Reducing hallucinations with enforced formats
- Clean and minimal demo code for learning

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- LangChain  
- LLMs (OpenAI / compatible models)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Designed for learning and experimentation, this repo helps you understand how to build **robust GenAI pipelines** where LLM outputs can be safely consumed by downstream systems.

---

⭐ Ideal for GenAI projects, interviews, and production-oriented workflows.
